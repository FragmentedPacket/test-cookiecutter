# My Plugin

A plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot).

## Installation

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip

```shell
pip install my-plugin
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.0.0b3 and higher

To ensure My Plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `my-plugin` package:

```no-highlight
# echo my-plugin >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `configuration.py`

```python
# In your configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["my_plugin"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "my_plugin": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings

## Usage

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:

- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. 

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--nautobot-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and Nautobot to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`
